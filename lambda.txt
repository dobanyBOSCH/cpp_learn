A **lambda** in C++ is a small, inline, anonymous function that you can define directly where you need it—without giving it a formal name.

They were introduced in **C++11** and are heavily used in modern C++ for callbacks, algorithms, and functional-style programming.

# 🔍 **What a Lambda Is — The Simple Explanation**

A **lambda expression** is a quick way to write a function *inside* your code.

Example:

```cpp
auto add = [](int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
};
cout << add(2, 3);   // prints 5
```

Here:

* `[]` is the capture list
* `(int a, int b)` are the parameters
* `{ return a + b; }` is the function body

Lambdas behave just like small, inline functions.

# 📌 **Why Lambdas Exist**

Before lambdas, you had to create functor structs just to pass functions:

```cpp
struct Add {
    int operator()(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
};
```

Now you can do it in one line.

# 🧠 **How Lambdas Work Internally**

Under the hood, a lambda generates a compiler-created class with:

* an `operator()` (call operator)
* member variables that store captured variables

This is why lambdas can capture local variables.

---

# ✋ **Capture List (the `[]` part)**

The capture list defines which outside variables the lambda is allowed to use:

### 1️⃣ Capture nothing

```cpp
[]() { /* ... */ }
```

### 2️⃣ Capture by value (copy)

```cpp
[x]() { cout << x; }
```

### 3️⃣ Capture by reference

```cpp
[&x]() { x = 10; }
```

### 4️⃣ Capture all by value

```cpp
[=]() { ... }
```

### 5️⃣ Capture all by reference

```cpp
[&]() { ... }
```

---

# ⚡ **`mutable` — Why It Exists**

By default, captured-by-value variables are **read-only** inside the lambda.

Example:

```cpp
int x = 10;
auto f = [x]() { x++; };  // ❌ error: cannot modify captured copy
```

To modify the *copy*, use `mutable`:

```cpp
auto f = [x]() mutable { x++; };
```

Important: this still does NOT modify the original `x`.

---

# 🌀 **Lambda + `auto` + STL**

Lambdas work beautifully with STL algorithms:

```cpp
vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4};

for_each(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int x){
    cout << x << " ";
});
```

Or filtering:

```cpp
auto it = find_if(v.begin(), v.end(),
                  [](int x){ return x % 2 == 0; });
```

---

# 📋 **Full Lambda Syntax Breakdown**

```
[captures] (parameters) -> return_type {
    body
};
```

Example:

```cpp
auto f = [x](int y) -> int {
    return x + y;
};
```

Return type can be omitted if obvious.

# 🧩 **Real Uses of Lambdas**

* Callbacks (GUI, networking, events)
* Sorting with custom rules
* Thread functions
* Functional-style data processing
* Replacing functor classes

Example: sorting by length

```cpp
sort(v.begin(), v.end(),
     [](const string& a, const string& b){
         return a.size() < b.size();
     });
```

# ✅ Want examples of advanced lambdas?

I can explain:

* generic lambdas (`auto` parameters)
* `std::function` vs lambdas
* capturing `this`
* capturing move-only objects
* recursive lambdas

Just tell me!
