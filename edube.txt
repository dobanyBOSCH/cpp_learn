object programming. 
procedural programming.



The object approach suggests a completely different way of thinking. 
The data and the code are enclosed together 
in the same world, 
divided into classes. 
Every class is like a recipe that can be used when you want to create a useful object (yes, this is where the name of the approach came from). 
You may produce as many objects as you need to solve your problem. 
Every object has a set of traits (they’re called properties) and 
is able to perform a set of activities (which are called methods).


Objects are incarnations of ideas expressed in classes, much like a piece of cheesecake on your plate is an incarnation of an idea expressed in the recipe printed in an old cookbook. 

•	a noun, you probably define the object’s name
•	adjective, you probably define the object’s property
•	a verb, you probably define the object’s activity

stack, lifo
lilo?


There’s another important fact worth mentioning: the constructors aren’t real functions. They don’t have any return type – not even void. You need to take this into consideration when declaring or defining a new constructor.

class Stack {
    private:
            int stackstore[100];
            int SP;
    public:
        Stack(void) { SP = 0; }
            void push(int value);
            int pop(void) {
                 return stackstore[--SP];
     }
};

void Stack::push(int value) {
            stackstore[SP++] = value;
}

A class is an aggregate consisting of variables (also called fields or properties) and functions (sometimes called methods). Both variables and functions are class components.

•	(*p).C // p is explicitly dereferenced in order to access the C component
•	p->C // p is implicitly dereferenced in order to access the C component



#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Class1 {
public:
	Class1(int val) { this -> value = val; } //konstruktor
	Class1(Class1 const &source) { value = source.value + 100; }
	int value;
};
class Class2 {
public:
	Class2(int val) { this -> value = val; }
	int value;
};
int main(void) {
	Class1 object11(100), object12 = object11;
	Class2 object21(200), object22 = object21;
	cout << object12.value << endl;
	cout << object22.value << endl;
	return 0;
}
